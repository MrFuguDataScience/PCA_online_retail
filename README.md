This is a multi-step process of the data life cycle: you will see how paying attention and diving into the data can be a big deal. This dataset is very robust in skill that you will practice because it has hidden gems which are very important. For example, considering that these data have cancelations and various interal codes reflect orders you have to really take your time. I separated this into many notebooks which go over each piece of the small project. You will be able to clean, extract, plot, perform PCA, do various tables to represent the data and this is not an exhaustive list.
